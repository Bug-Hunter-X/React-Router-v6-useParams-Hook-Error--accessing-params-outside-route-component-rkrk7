In React Router Dom v6, attempting to use the `useParams` hook outside of a component rendered within a route that defines the route params will result in an error.  The error message might not be immediately clear, indicating something like undefined parameters or incorrect usage of the hook.  The root cause is that `useParams` relies on the route's context, which isn't available outside of its scope.
